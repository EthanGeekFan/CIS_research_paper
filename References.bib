Abstract = {The technology evolution and application popularity in cloud computing has driven the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) services and applications. When these real-time events in IoT applications are transmitted to the cloud for processing, the load on cloud computing becomes heavier, which can result in processing delays and exceeding the processing deadline. To improve upon and solve problems derived from many and more real-time events in the cloud computing process, some have proposed a fog computing concept. Previous studies on fog computing are mainly focused on accurately defining the fog computing concept and its possible applications. The nodes in fog computing are closer to edge devices, which can process such these real-time events in this layer. With this fog process, processing efficiency can be significantly increased and delays can also be solved in cloud computing.},
