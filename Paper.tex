\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} is going to be an essay that follows the IEEE standard.
I am now writing casually without thinking what I am doing. So, the 
sentence may seem irreadable.

This is Liye Jia's part! \\

He decided to edit his part in Microsoft Word first 
before we format his document in this final document. \\

There are multiple options for creating an IoT network: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee. 
Each of them has its own characteristics. However, in our system, one specific networking 
technology should be chosen to connect the sensors on people's body and the smart device that has 
internet connection via either Wi-Fi or Cellular. Our candidates are:
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item Wi-Fi
    \item Bluetooth Classic
    \item ZigBee
    \item Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE)

\end{itemize}
